# SPL Final Project
# Healthcare Behavioral Group Therapy  
**Team:** Code-Blooded  
**Language:** F#, Express.js, MongoDB  

---

## Project Overview
The **Healthcare Behavioral Group Therapy** application is designed to support **group therapy sessions** in a secure, compliant, and effective manner. The system aims to help therapists, patients, and healthcare administrators manage sessions, users, and RSVPs efficiently while ensuring **HIPAA compliance** and data security.

---

## Objectives
- Develop a secure, scalable platform for managing **group therapy sessions**.  
- Enable patients and therapists to schedule, join, and manage sessions.  
- Ensure **HIPAA compliance** and strict data privacy standards.  
- Provide both a **functional F# backend API** and an **Express.js frontend** for easy access.

---

## System Architecture

### **1. Backend (F# Business API Layer)**
- Core API endpoints for patient registration, session scheduling, and therapist session management.  
- Secure connections to MongoDB for CRUD operations.  
- Authentication and authorization implemented for all endpoints.  
- Unit and integration tests with **95% passing rate**.

### **2. Frontend (Express.js Application)**
- Handles user interactions and session management views.  
- Provides pages for registration, login, session listing, and RSVP management.  
- Frontend development is scheduled for **early November 2025**.

### **3. Database (MongoDB)**
- Stores patient, therapist, event, and RSVP data.  
- Encrypted user credentials and secure access.  
- Supports flexible schema evolution.

## Team Contributions

**Rucha & Nidhi** – *EventController*  
- Connected to MongoDB and managed the `events` collection.  
- Implemented `GetEvent`, `CreateEvent`, `UpdateEvent`, and `DeleteEvent` endpoints.  
- Ensured proper JSON serialization and logging for API actions.  
- Added validation and summary response generation for new events.

**Sanjyot** – *UserController*  
- Managed the `users` collection in MongoDB.  
- Developed `GetUsers`, `CreateUser`, and `Login` endpoints.  
- Implemented insertion and logging logic for new user and login operations.  
- Handled JSON responses and simple authentication flow.

**Chetan** – *RsvpController*  
- Created endpoints for RSVP management (`GetRsvps`, `CreateRsvp`, `DeleteRsvp`).  
- Ensured smooth CRUD operations and robust logging.  
- Validated RSVP creation and deletion processes.

**Sudeepta** – *Event Data Models*  
- Defined `Event`, `newEvent`, `GetEvent`, and `UpdateEvent` models.  
- Integrated BSON attributes to align F# types with MongoDB schema.  
- Simplified host handling for event retrievals and updates.  

---

## Challenges Faced
- Difficulty integrating **F# APIs** with **Express.js frontend** due to data format mismatches.  
- Limited resources for advanced **F# functional programming** practices.  
- Managing multiple MongoDB controllers occasionally caused model conflicts.  
- Pending **HIPAA compliance review** for full production readiness.  
- Tight timeline led to intense debugging and coordination cycles.

These challenges improved the team’s debugging, collaboration, and time management skills.

---

## Next Steps
- Begin frontend integration via **Express.js**.  
- Conduct **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** with a sample dataset.  
- Finalize HIPAA compliance review and perform security audits.  
- Prepare documentation and deployment scripts before **Nov 15, 2025**.

---

## Testing
- Unit and integration tests completed for all backend APIs (95% pass rate).  
- Frontend and UAT testing scheduled post-integration phase.
